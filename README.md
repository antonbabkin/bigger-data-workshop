# Scaling up empirical research to bigger data with Python

Workshop materials for the [2021 Data Science Research Bazaar](https://datascience.wisc.edu/data-science-research-bazaar/) at UW-Madison.

This workshop is intended for researchers who have experience in analyzing data that comfortably fits in memory but are interested in scaling up to bigger than memory datasets. The following topics will be covered: measuring performance and memory usage; sampling and split-apply-combine strategy; data type optimization; efficient storage with parquet; simple parallelization; introduction to Dask. Participants interested in following along will be provided with an example dataset and instructions on setting up a programming environment. All workshop materials will be publicly available in this GitHub repository. A [prerequisite exercise](prereq.ipynb) should give you an idea of expected prior knowledge of Python and pandas.
